A simple lambda calculus solver, inspired by assigment 2 of uWaterloo CS 442 - Programming Languages.

You can run a (admittedly not that good) CLI using `dune exec bin/lambda_cli.exe`.

You can also just use the libraries provided using `dune utop` and opening `Lambda_calc`.

NOR, AOE, and Eta reductions are implemented, as well as a to\_debruijn function.

Thanks to Gregor Richards for help with writing an unambiguous Lambda Calc grammar.
